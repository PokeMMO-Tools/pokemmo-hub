Once new items are added here are the steps to follow:

1. look at yibu github pokedex -> dist -> database -> item.json

2. copy and paste new items to our item.json (you will have to reformat), dont forget es, and fr_name.
dex = api id

4. now go to apiItems.json and map dexid's to respective id.

5. NOW CHECK if EVENT BAGS AND add them to item_lookup. for previous years, find and add the year, like (2025), to the name and key. this is in item.json and item_lookup.
then apiItems

//ignore this i thinkg find the id's of the event bags, the years use the same id's in yibu's item.json, then just map that to the new api id
    example goodie bag is always id 801, and pumpking is 802. just need to map the api id to it.

6. if not a cosmetic, update item images, yibus github, static -> images -> item, and paste new images in our same data structure (static, images.)

7. ALSO UPDATE THE item_cosmetic.json (if its a cosmetic item) or cosmetic images wont render
